### Hi, I'm Vini (he/him)

I'm a researcher and developer interested in marine microbiology, specially microbial community ecology and functional diversity. My current work focuses on bioinformatics techniques for analysing metagenomics data. My language of choice is Python but I dabble in R and Bash as well.
